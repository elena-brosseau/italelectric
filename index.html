                <h2>SUSTAINABILITY CAN BE <span class="stylish">STYLISH</span></h2>
                <p>
                    It’s a simple fact that cannot be ignored. In a world where we’re bombarded with negative news and information, it can be challenging to find the time and energy to figure out how to make a positive impact on the environment. But ItalElectric offers a solution - we combine sustainability with practicality and style.
                    <br><br>
                    By transforming the beloved Fiat 500 into a sleek and eco-friendly car of the future, customized to fit the customer’s taste and personality, we’re not only doing good for the planet but also for ourselves. We’re breathing new life into vehicles that were once destined for the scrapyard, and we’re doing it all in the name of sustainability. ItalElectric is dedicated to crafting a functional car that looks cool and helps protect the environment.

                    <h3>e-500™ Nuova</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the new (or Nuova) body style that kicked off the classic 500 in the mid 1950’s and was designed to help Italians coming out of difficult economic times to transition from the Vespa to a practical car. The model features a fabric roof foldable to the rear of the vehicle - a true cabriolet. This keeps the car light and well ventilated.

                    <h3>e-500™ Bambino</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Bambino body style differs from the Nuova in having a fabric roof only above the passengers and was the most widely used 500. A solid glass rear window makes for good visibility and might be a bit better for colder areas - still easily ventilated for hotter areas.

                    <p>
                        The Italian custom coach company Ghia designed a "Jolly" variant of the 500, based on the famous Fiat 600 Jolly, with an open-air, doorless design with wicker seats and a removable fabric canopy roof. The Jolly was used as taxis on the island of Catalina off the coast of Los Angeles in the US from 1958 to 1962. These were used by the rich and famous to scoot around their estates.

                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>
                            At ItalElectric, our story is rooted in the passion for saving and transforming iconic cars from Italy into highly efficient electric vehicles. It all began with the collaboration of two small family businesses working hand in hand to bring these exceptional cars to the United States.
                            <br><br>
                            A local restoration shop located just outside Rome took it upon themselves to breathe new life into these cars. They painstakingly salvaged and rejuvenated each one, meticulously converting them into highly functioning electric vehicles that not only perform exceptionally but also align with our commitment to sustainability.
                            <br><br>
                            Every car we work on has its own unique story, its own history, some dating all the way back to the 50s. Many of them were abandoned, forgotten in garages and at risk of being sent to junk yards in Italy. So with your purchase you will also receive detailed information about your car’s history.
                            <br><br>
                            Our partnership is built on upcycling; bringing these forgotten gems back to life. We believe in preserving the heritage and soul of these cars while embracing the advancements of technology and the need for greener transportation solutions. 
                            <br><br>
                            Join us in celebrating our love for Italy, its remarkable cars, and our dedication to preserving them while making a positive impact on the world. Experience the beauty, grace, and thrill of driving an ItalElectric – where history meets the future, and sustainability meets style.
